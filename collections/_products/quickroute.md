## Custom routes for first responders

QuickRoute provides custom driving routes to ensure first responders can navigate to an emergency quickly. Off-the-shelf consumer mapping solutions like Google Maps are great for everyday driving, but QuickRoute accounts for first responders' alternative driving procedures and some of the restrictions common to operating a larger vehicle. QuickRoute uses multiple data streams including: a global database of road and infrastructure updated daily; manufacturer specs for common vehicle types (ladder, ambulance, crash truck, patrol car, water, tender, etc.); as well as road and bridge weight limits and tunnel and bridge clearance from the US Department of Transportation

## Use devices you already own

QuickRoute works on the devices you already use. The app is currently available for download in the Apple App Store and is coming soon to the Android and Google Play Store.

## Nationwide maps showing road obstructions in real time

QuickRoute allows mobile and ECC users to tag road obstructions including hazards, flooding, accidents, construction and other obstacles. All road obstructions appear on everyone's map in real time. Provided routes automatically take road obstructions into account.

## Live sync with ECC

As part of the Enterprise-level subscription, the ECC app features an interactive map display with vehicle tracking, pushes routes to users for hands-free navigation, and pre-plans road outages. QuickRoute ECC map screen may also be used as a low cost AVL system or as a backup if CAD goes down.

## Completely customizable for your specific needs

If the 12 pre-loaded vehicle types don't meet your specific requirements, QuickRoute allows for complete customization. Create new driving profiles with your exact vehicle dimensions and with the threshold above the posted speed limit your jurisdiction allows you to drive.
